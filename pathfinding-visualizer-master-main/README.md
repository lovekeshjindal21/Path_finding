Path - Finding Visualizer | BFS, Dijkstra’s, A* Search algorithm, HTML, CSS, Javascript Dec 2021

• Developed a Pathfinding Visualizer that gives the visual representation of the shortest path from source to destination
with some obstacles in a grid using multiple shortest path algorithms.

• Provided users the interface through which they can visualize the shortest path from source to destination through
Breadth - First Search, Dijkstra’s and A* Search Algorithms which are implemented in Javascript.
